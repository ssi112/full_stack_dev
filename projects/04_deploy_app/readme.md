# Deploy Your Flask App to Kubernetes Using EKS

## Project Submission

You should submit your project using your project's Github repo.

Please provide the IP address of your running application in the submission notes, as the reviewer will use the IP address to check that your application is running correctly.

You should leave your application deployment up and running until you receive your project feedback. To avoid incurring additional costs, please remember to tear down your application after you have received feedback.
