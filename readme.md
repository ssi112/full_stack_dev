## Project #1
Create a booking site Fy-yur that facilitates bookings between artists who can play at venues, and venues who want to book artists.

* [Starter code](https://github.com/udacity/FSND/tree/master/projects/01_fyyur/starter_code) with overview, structure, instructions and criteria.
* The rubric for this project can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2653/view)

Most of the code for this project is in place. It needs the data models built to access a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.
